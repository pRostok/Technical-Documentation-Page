                <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage.
                HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image,
                multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.</p>
                <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different
                meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into
                logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images
                and videos into a page</p>

                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
                It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. </p>
                <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which
                you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing
                tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
                following line of text:</p>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&ltp&gt)
                    element: 
                <code> &ltp&gt cat is very grumpy &ltp/&gt </code>

                <ul>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and
                    closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it
                    precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.
                    This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar
                    results.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy,
                we could wrap the word very in a &ltstrong&gt element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
                <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is &ltstrong&gtvery&lt/strong&gt grumpy.&lt/p&gt</code>
                <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <span>p</span> element first, then opened the
                <span>strong</span> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <span>strong</span> element first, before closing the <span>p</span>.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
                <code>&ltp&gtMy cat is &ltstrong&gtvery grumpy.&lt/p&gt&lt/strong&gt</code>
                <p>The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the
                    example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Block_versus_inline_elements">
            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content
                    that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are
                    usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested
                    inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's content (not
                    entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is
                    typically used with text, for example an <span>&lta&gt</span> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <span>&ltem&gt</span> or <span>&ltstrong&gt</span> create emphasis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consider the following example:</p>
                <code>&ltem&gtfirst&lt/em&gt&ltem&gtsecond&lt/em&gt&ltem&gtthird&lt/em&gt</code> <!-- <em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em> -->
                <code>&ltp&gtfourth&lt/p&gt&ltp&gtfifth&lt/p&gt&ltp&gtsixth&lt/p&gt</code>  <!-- <p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p> -->
                <p><span>&ltem&gt</span> is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in between. On
                    the other hand, <span>&ltp&gt</span> is a block-level element. Each p element appears on a new line, with space above and below. (The
                        spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)
                </p>
                <code>
                    <em>first</em>
                    <em>second</em>
                    <em>third</em>
                    <p>first</p>
                    <p>second</p>
                    <p>third</p>
                </code>

                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img src="img/atr.png">
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <span>class</span>
                attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
                <P>An attribute should have:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be
                    separated by spaces too.)</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>

                <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an
                entire HTML page:</p>
                 <img class="fimg" src="img/anat.png">
                 <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <span>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</span>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules
                        that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this:</li>
                    <li> <span>&lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt</span>: The <span>&lthtml&gt</span> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                    <li> <span>&lthead&gt&lt/head&gt</span>: The <span>&lthead&gt</span> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the
                        content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search
                        results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next
                        article of the series.</li>
                    <li> <span>&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</span>: The <span>&ltmeta&gt</span> element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like
                        <span>&ltbase&gt</span>, <span>&ltlink&gt</span>, <span>&ltscript&gt</span>, <span>&ltstyle&gt</span> or <span>&lttitle&gt</span>. The <span>charset</span> attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of 
                        human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.</li>
                    <li> <span>&lttitle&gt&lt/title&gt</span>: The <span>&lttitle&gt</span> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser
                        tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
                    <li> <span>&ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt</span>: The <span>&ltbody&gt</span> element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable
                        audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to
                the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is
                very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it.
                Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.</p>
                <p>To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <span>&lt!--</span> and <span>--&gt</span>. For example:</p>
                <code> &ltp&gtI'm not inside a comment&lt/p&gt <p>&lt!-- &ltp&gtI am!&lt/p&gt --&gt</p> </code>
                <p>As you can see below, only the first paragraph is displayed in the live output.</p>
                <code> <p>I'm not inside a comment</p> </code>

                <p>At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to
                write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on some of the topics introduced
                here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.</p>
